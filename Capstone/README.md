# Capstone Project: Comprehensive OSINT Investigation

This capstone project is designed to integrate and apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the "Mastering OSINT with Jupyter Notebook" course. You will conduct a comprehensive OSINT investigation based on a realistic scenario, documenting your entire process within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Objective

Apply the full range of learned skills (data collection, analysis, visualization, automation, ethical considerations) to a complex, realistic OSINT investigation.

## Scenario

*(A detailed scenario will be provided here. Examples: investigating a suspected insider threat, analyzing the spread of a specific piece of malware C2 infrastructure, mapping the network of an extremist group, tracking a disinformation campaign, performing due diligence on a fictitious company.)*

**Placeholder Scenario:** Investigate the online presence and potential connections of a fictitious activist group, "EcoWarriors United," suspected of planning disruptive protests. Focus on identifying key members, communication platforms, funding sources (if any), and planned activities using only publicly available information.

## Deliverables

1.  **Jupyter Notebook (`Capstone_Investigation.ipynb`):** A detailed notebook documenting the entire investigation process:
    *   **Planning:** Clearly define the investigation goals based on the scenario.
    *   **Collection:** Document the sources consulted and methods used (including code for scraping/APIs).
    *   **Processing:** Show how raw data was cleaned and structured.
    *   **Analysis:** Detail the analytical steps taken, including code, interpretations, and visualizations (graphs, maps, network diagrams).
    *   **Evidence:** Include relevant snippets, screenshots (use Markdown `![alt text](path/to/image.png)`), and links.
    *   **Ethical/Legal:** Explicitly state the ethical considerations and legal boundaries adhered to throughout the investigation.
2.  **Final Report (Generated from Notebook or separate .md):** A concise summary of key findings, evidence, conclusions, and any limitations or unanswered questions. This should be suitable for presentation to a non-technical stakeholder.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Methodology:** Appropriateness and justification of OSINT techniques used.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Thoroughness of the investigation within ethical/legal bounds.
- **Technical Execution:** Quality and efficiency of Python code, data handling, and visualization.
- **Analytical Depth:** Insightfulness of the analysis and conclusions drawn.
- **Documentation:** Clarity, organization, and reproducibility of the Jupyter Notebook.
- **Reporting:** Professionalism and clarity of the final summary report.
- **Ethical Conduct:** Strict adherence to ethical principles and legal requirements.

## Getting Started

1.  Review the provided scenario carefully.
2.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook named `Capstone_Investigation.ipynb` within this directory.
3.  Begin with the Planning phase, outlining your approach.
4.  Proceed through the Intelligence Cycle, documenting each step in the notebook.
5.  Remember to save frequently and comment your code.
